    The total chat app, including the ask/answer component for soliciting a
    name
    comments, etc. is listed on this page. 
    There is no special code to support AJAX/Comet
    (all the wrapping is done automatically by <i>Lift</i>).
  </p>

  <p>
    When the Chat comet widget is added to the page, it needs to solict the
    user for a "chat name".  It asks the "AskName" comet widget for the name.
    Until the AskName comet widget provides a name, all rendering messages
    are forwarded to AskName.
    Here's the code for the "AskName":</p>

    <div data-lift="github?file=net/liftweb/example/comet/Chat.scala&lines=30-108"></div>

  <p>
    This example demonstrates the power of Scala's Actors and <i>Lift</i>.
    With very few lines of code, we've got a complete AJAX/Comet app that
    has Seaside style Ask/Answer for building modal dialogs.
