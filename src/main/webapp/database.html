<p><i>Lift</i> allows you to create model objects that
map themselves to and from the database.  Here's an example of
a "User" model object.</p>

<p>
	<div data-lift="Database?form=post">
	There are <database:count ></database:count> records in the "Person" table.  The first one is <database:first></database:first>.
	Press <database:submit></database:submit> to create more records.
	</div>
	</p>

    <div data-lift="github?file=net/liftweb/example/model/User.scala&lines=25-46"></div>

<p>For this little bit of work, we get a complete user with
first name, last name, password, email, and a personal essay.

Each of the fields knows how to validate itself.  The
User (and any other "Mapped" class) knows how to Create,
Update, Read, and Delete itself from the database.  It knows
how to convert itself to a string, to XML, and even generate
HTML forms for itself.</p>
